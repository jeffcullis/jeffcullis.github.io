## Experience ##

### Computational Biologist ###
**[Centre for Clinical Genomics](http://ccgenomics.ca)** at the
[Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://bcgsc.ca).<br>
**September 2015 -- June 2018**<br>

**Skills and Responsibilities**

* Developed features for an object-oriented Python-based system used to analyze patient data and build clinical reports for 150-200 cancer patients per month.
* Worked within a team with a high level of quality consciousness; new features required extensive unit tests, peer code review, and a formal release process was required prior to making any change to the production environment.
* Carried out predictive and retrospective statistical analyses of major changes to the clinical reporting system and reported findings in regular team meetings.
* Made significant contributions towards automation of the clinical reporting system as well as simplifying and automating methods for generating monthly quality indicator reports.
* Augmented my experience with Python, R, git, Bitbucket, code reviews, Linux shell, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, JIRA, and test-driven development.

**Projects**

* Designed, developed, validated, and released new features and made other contributions to the CCG [hereditary cancer panel](http://ccgenomics.ca/hcp-panel.html) and [somatic cancer panels](http://ccgenomics.ca/oncopanel-and-myeloid-panel.html).

### Biodiversity Bioinformatics Programmer ###
**[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng)** at the [Ottawa Research and Development Centre](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/research-centres-and-collections/ontario/ottawa-research-and-development-centre/ottawa-research-and-development-centre/?id=1180546650582).<br>
**April 2013 -- August 2015**<br>

**Skills and Responsibilities**

* Developed a software platform for parallel processing of genomics and transcriptomics analyses, including tracking of all associated sequencing and processing metadata and optimization for execution via a high-performance compute cluster.
* Used this platform to perform steps from raw sequence data acquisition, management, and quality control, through to genome and transcriptome assembly, evaluation, and formal data release process.
* Responsible for organization and management of over 60TB of genomics and genome assembly data, from raw inputs through to final output data release.
* Worked directly with numerous researchers to improve upon genomics and transcriptomics outputs and to perform additional customized analyses.
* Supervised four co-op students with projects focused on gene annotation and metagenomics analysis.
* Gained significant experience using the following languages and technologies: Perl, R, Python, Linux shell, Rocks Cluster Distribution, Galaxy, Subversion, Git, and Bugzilla.

**Projects**

* Galaxy migration of genome assembly and annotation tools.
* Genomic DNA contaminant identification, visualization, and removal.
* [Genome assembly project.](/work_projects/genome_assembly_project.html)
* [Automated bioinformatics SGE cluster tool submission.](/work_projects/qsub_omics_project.html)

### Research Associate ###
**[Mood Disorders Research Group](https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/psychiatry/research/mood-disorders.html)**, within the [Dalhousie University Department of Medicine](http://medicine.dal.ca).<br>
**October 2008 -- March 2013**<br>

**Skills and Responsibilities**
* Organized terabytes of human genotype data from 7000 subjects and created software to run nearly 2000 separate genome-wide analyses using this data.
* Created scripts to clean, organize, and analyze terabytes of neuroimaging data from nearly 500 subjects across a wide range of projects. 
* Developed parallelized R software to generate and analyze 1M simulated genotypes replicated 10K times under multiple genetic models.
* Performed numerous image processing analyses across large datasets, including diffusion/tractography, functional connectivity, and morphometry analyses.
* Created software to parse thousands of neurocognitive testing results, load data into SQL databases, clean data, remove duplicates, and generate statistics.
* Responsible for the administration of most of the computational, storage, and data organization needs for a research group consisting of 12 staff.
* Co-author of four journal articles reporting the results of some of the studies described above.

**Projects**

* [Impact of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity on complex diseases.](/work_projects/heterogeneity_gwas_project.html)
* [Replicable evidence for the involvement of the right inferior frontal gyrus in bipolar disorder.](/work_projects/rifg_project.html)
* [Effect of illness burden and treatment on hippocampal volumes.](/work_projects/hippocampus_project.html)
* [Prefrontal cortex N-acetylaspartate affected by lithium in patients with bipolar disorder.](/work_projects/prefrontal_project.html)
* [Management of neurocognitive testing data.](/work_projects/nct_data_project.html)
