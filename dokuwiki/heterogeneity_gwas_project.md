===== Impact of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity on complex diseases =====

=== Project Description ===
In this study we used real (WTCCC) and simulated (using R) genotypic data to assess the sample size needed to identify causal genes with GWAS (plink software) with sufficient power. We intermixed genotypes with varying amounts of true and false positive phenotypes in order to simulate the effect of mixed diagnoses according to a broader definition of the phenotype than genetics would dictate (heterogeneity). For the simulated case, data was generated according to multiple models of inheritance. The results showed that even modest presence of heterogeneity would result in a prohibitively large sample size needed to detect associated genes.
