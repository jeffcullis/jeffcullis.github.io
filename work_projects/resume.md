## Experience ##

### Technical Coordinator ###
**[Blue Spruce Nursery](https://bluesprucenursery.ca)**<br>
**April – October 2025**
*   Setup software and systems for a new garden centre business venture.
*   Setup and management of the Square Retail point of sale system for processing plant orders, sales, and inventory management.
*   Setup and management of Orisha and Harnois greenhouse automation software.


### Technical Director ###
**[Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System (CIOOS) Atlantic](https://cioosatlantic.ca)**<br>
**Februrary 2019 -- July 2023**<br>

*   Worked with organizations collecting oceanographic data in Atlantic Canada to make  datasets findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) through the cioos.ca open-access data catalogue.
    *   Participated and problem-solved all stages of the data management lifecycle:
    *   Held regular meetings with new and existing data providers and provided guidance, motivation, and technical expertise towards making their datasets FAIR.
    *   Developed code, tools, and processes to collect, transfer and transform the data and metadata into standardized interoperable formats.
    *   Performed data and metadata quality checks prior to data publication.
*   Worked with national teams to build consistent metadata standards and entry forms, data acquisition strategies and tools, and data management plans across regions.
*   Worked with US and international partners on best practices for data and metadata standards, quality control, and support for a diversity of data types and variables.
*   Core technologies: CentOS Linux, Apache, Docker, Python, Github, Atlassian JIRA.


### Computational Biologist ###
**[Centre for Clinical Genomics](http://ccgenomics.ca)** at the
[Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre](http://bcgsc.ca).<br>
**September 2015 -- June 2018**<br>

**Skills and Responsibilities**

*   Developed features for an object-oriented Python software pipeline used to analyze patient data and build clinical reports for 150-200 cancer patients per month.
*   Quality was assessed consistently and production changes were released following an SOP that included functional and unit tests and peer code review.
*   Automated large portions of the clinical reporting and quality indicator systems.
*   Core technologies: Python, R, Git, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Atlassian JIRA


**Projects**

* Designed, developed, validated, and released new features and made other contributions to the CCG [hereditary cancer panel](http://ccgenomics.ca/hcp-panel.html) and [somatic cancer panels](http://ccgenomics.ca/oncopanel-and-myeloid-panel.html).

### Biodiversity Bioinformatics Programmer ###
**[Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng)** at the [Ottawa Research and Development Centre](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/research-centres-and-collections/ontario/ottawa-research-and-development-centre/ottawa-research-and-development-centre/?id=1180546650582).<br>
**April 2013 -- August 2015**<br>

**Skills and Responsibilities**

*   Designed and implemented a parallel, high-performance object-oriented software platform for genome assembly and analysis, including centralized metadata store.
*   Performed raw sequence data acquisition, management, and QC, genome and transcriptome assembly, evaluation, and formal data and metadata release.
*   Responsible for organization and management of over 60TB of genomics and genome assembly data.
*   Supervised several co-op students and worked with researchers to perform customized analyses including gene annotation and metagenomics analysis.
*   Core technologies: R, Python, Perl, Linux, Git.


**Projects**

* Galaxy migration of genome assembly and annotation tools.
* Genomic DNA contaminant identification, visualization, and removal.
* [Genome assembly project.](/work_projects/genome_assembly_project.html)
* [Automated bioinformatics SGE cluster tool submission.](/work_projects/qsub_omics_project.html)

### Research Associate ###
**[Mood Disorders Research Group](https://medicine.dal.ca/departments/department-sites/psychiatry/research/mood-disorders.html)**, within the [Dalhousie University Department of Medicine](http://medicine.dal.ca).<br>
**October 2008 -- March 2013**<br>

**Skills and Responsibilities**
*   Organized terabytes of human genotype data from 7000 subjects and created software to run nearly 2000 separate genome-wide analyses and simulate genotype data under various models for a large-scale analysis.
*   Created scripts to clean, organize, and analyze terabytes of neuroimaging data from nearly 500 subjects across a wide range of projects and performed diffusion tractography, functional connectivity, and morphometry analyses.


**Projects**

* [Impact of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity on complex diseases.](/work_projects/heterogeneity_gwas_project.html)
* [Replicable evidence for the involvement of the right inferior frontal gyrus in bipolar disorder.](/work_projects/rifg_project.html)
